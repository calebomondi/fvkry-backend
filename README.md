## Overview
FVKRY PRVNTA is a financial discipline tool designed to help virtual asset owners manage impulsive spending and trading by locking assets (ETH and ERC-20 tokens) for set durations. Users can create multiple sub-vaults within the defined main vaults to manage their locked assets securely. By implementing strategic asset locking mechanisms, the protocol provides structure in volatile markets, countering cognitive biases and promoting long-term financial stability.
